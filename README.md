## How to Install

First, you must have the [Arduino Desktop IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage) installed.

On this [mindsensors/EVs_UIModule](https://github.com/mindsensors/EVs_UIModule) GitHub repository, 
click the green "Clone or download" button in the top-left of the page. Then click "Download Zip."

Open the Arduino IDE. Go to Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library, and select the Zip file you downloaded.

If you are having trouble, try the [Installing Additional Arduino Libraries](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries) guide.

## Dependencies

This library requires the [adafruit/Adafruit_ILI9340](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_ILI9340) library, 
which requires the [adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library) library. 
Download and add both of these libraries as well.

If you are using this product with an [EVShield](http://www.mindsensors.com/arduino/16-evshield-for-arduino-duemilanove-or-uno),
